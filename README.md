# Machine Learning-Statistical-Measures-and-Hypothesis-Testing
In my latest project, I conducted a statistical analysis 📐 of a dataset featuring students' exam performance, revealing important insights through descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. This analysis aimed to discover patterns in math, reading, and writing scores to identify educational trends 📚.

🔑 Key Highlights:

- Calculated mean, median, mode, and explored standard deviations 📏 across all score columns for an insightful summary.

- Utilized boxplots 📊 and computed the Interquartile Range (IQR) to detect and handle outliers, ensuring accurate data analysis.

- Visualized score distributions through histograms and density plots 📉, identifying trends in score skewness.

- Performed hypothesis testing (t-test) 📊 to assess whether students who completed a test preparation course showed better math performance 🧠. With a p-value of 1.25e-07, the null hypothesis was rejected, indicating significant improvement in scores 🎯.

🌟 Impact:

- The findings indicate that test preparation courses 📝 positively affect student performance, stressing the value of educational resources. These insights are essential for educators and policymakers in enhancing test preparation programs 🏫.

This project demonstrates my expertise in working with real-world data, using tools like Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform key statistical analyses and generate actionable insights 🔍.
